Maybe Black Mesa? That was a joke Haha - Fat Chance Anyway this cake is great It's so delicious and moist Look at me: still talking When there's science to do When I look out there, It makes me GLaD I'm not you I've experiments to run There is research to be done On the people who are Still alive And believe me I am Still alive I'm doing science and I'm Still alive I feel fantastic and I'm Still alive While you're dying I'll be Still alive And when you're dead I will be Still alive Still alive",
