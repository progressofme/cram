# 𝐂𝐑𝐀𝐌𝐏𝐘

Welcome to CRAMPY - Custom Randomness. This project is in beta, or just a test. Not sure yet.

# How to make it work

Download crampy.py, open a new file in the same directory as crampy.py, use 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐲 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐩, and then use 𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐩(𝟏,𝟏𝟎𝟎) to generate a random number 1-100.

# How does it work?

Crampy uses things on your computer, such as how much ram you have, temp file hashes, 15 files from your Downloads and Desktop into a Md5 Hash (We do not store this data).

We then do a bunch more stuff, including Portal Quotes to make sure that this is completely random.

After we gather all the hashes of this, we combine it all into one hash.

Then, we take all the numbers from the hash, and divide it until we have a perfectly random number for you to use.

# Cool Features

If you are running this in a place like replit, it will work just the same.

Crampy is actually faster in generating numbers than secrets and random

If you don't believe me, run this code: https://replit.com/@progressofme/CrampyTimeTester?v=1

# Known bugs

cramp(1,2) or similar results in nothing appearing

# Fun Facts

1. This was originally going to be a private key generator, with the same script. Now, I take the numbers from what would have been the private key and other numbers to generate these numbers

2. You can actually use some of the things that we use to make the script externally (𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐲 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐠𝐦𝐝𝟓𝐡𝐨𝐟) and running 𝐠𝐦𝐝𝟓𝐡𝐨𝐟(𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐡) with a actual path will return a folder's md5 hash. You can also use 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐲 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐬𝐮𝐦_𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐥_𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐬 and have a float variable in there, and it will add together all the numbers (12.34 or 1+2+3+4 = a return of 10)

More fun facts to come once they become fun again
