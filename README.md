# 𝐂𝐑𝐀𝐌

Welcome to CRAM - Custom Randomness. This project is in beta, or just a test. Not sure yet.

# How to make it work

Download cram.py, open a new file in the same directory as cram.py, use 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐦 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐦, and then use 𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐦(𝟏,𝟏𝟎𝟎) to generate a random number 1-100.

# How does it work?

Cram uses things on your computer, such as ram, temp files, 15 files from your Downloads, Documents, Photos, and Desktop into a Md5 Hash (We do not store this data).

We then do a bunch more stuff, including Portal Quotes to make sure that this is completely random.

After we gather all the hashes of this, we combine it all into one hash.

Then, we take all the numbers from the hash, and divide it until we have a perfectly random number for you to use.

# Known bugs

We know that if you put in too large of a number, then it will cause bugs.
